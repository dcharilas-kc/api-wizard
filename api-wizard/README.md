# API Wizard README Template

## Things to note

- In `content/open-api-spec.yaml` you may be offended by the placement of `{% for ... %} ... {% endfor %}` in this file BUT this is necessary since the directives are replaced with whitespace otherwise, and the generated YAML looks _awful_. So yes, there's a reason for that horrible formatting!
